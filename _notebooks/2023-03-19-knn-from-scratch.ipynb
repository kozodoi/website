    "# 1. Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This blog post provides a tutorial on implementing the K Nearest Neighbors algorithm using Python and NumPy. We will set up a simple class object, implement relevant methods to perform the prediction, and illustrate how it works on a toy dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are we implementing KNN from scratch if the algorithm is already available in `scikit-learn`? First, coding something from scratch is the best way to understand it. You may know many ML algorithms, but being able to write it down indicates that you have really mastered it. Second, implementing algorithms from scratch is a common task in ML interviews in tech companies, which makes it a useful skill that a job candidate should practice. Last but not least, it's a fun exercise, right? :)\n",

    "Before we jump to the implementation, let's quickly refresh our minds. How does KNN work? \n",
    "\n",
    "KNN is one of the so-called lazy algorithms, which means that there is no actual training step. Instead, KNN memorizes the training data by storing the feature values of training examples. Given a new example to be predicted, KNN calculates distances between the new example and each of the examples in the training set. The prediction returned by the KNN algorithm is simply the average value of the target variable across the K nearest neighbors of the new example.\n",
