The project was completed within the scope of the [Udacity Machine Learning Engineer](https://confirm.udacity.com/LMMJDA7C) nano-degree program and the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/aptos2019-blindness-detection/data) hosted by the Asia Pacific Tele-Ophthalmology Society (APTOS).\n",

    "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of vision loss. The World Health Organization reports that more than 300 million people worldwide have diabetes (Wong et al 2016). According to a recent study from International Diabetes Federation, the global prevalence of DR among the individuals with diabetes for the period from 2015 to 2019 was at more than 25% (Thomas et al 2019). The disease prevalence has been rising rapidly in developing countries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Early detection and treatment are crucial steps towards preventing DR. The screening procedure requires a trained clinical expert to examine the fundus photographs of the patient's retina. This creates delays in diagnosis and treatment of the disease. This is especially relevant for developing countries, which often lack qualified medical stuff to perform the diagnosis. Automated detection of DR can speed up the efficiency and coverage of the screening programs."

In practice, the severity of DR is diagnosed by the presence of different visual cues on the retina photographs.

    "Visual inspection of retina images suggests that images taken from cameras with different aspect ratios result in some images having large black areas around the eye. The black areas do not contain information relevant for prediction and can be cropped. However, we see that the size of black areas varies from one image to another. To address this, we develop a cropping function that converts the image to grayscale and marks black areas based on the pixel intensity. Next, we find a mask of the image by selecting rows and columns in which all pixels exceed the intensity threshold. This helps to remove vertical or horizontal rectangles filled with black similar to the ones observed in the upper-right image in Figure 4. After removing the black stripes, we resize the images to the same height and width.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another issue is the eye shape. Depending on the image parameters, some eyes appear to have a circular form, whereas others look like ovals. As the size and shape of items located in the retina determine the disease severity, it is crucial to standardize the eye shape as well. To do so, we develop another cropping function that makes a circular crop of a particular radius around the center of the image.\n",

    "This looks much better! Comparing the retina images to the ones before the preprocessing, we can see that the apparent discrepancies between the photographs are now fixed. The eyes now have a similar circular shape and the color scheme is more consistent. This should help the model to detect the signs of the DR on the photographs.\n",
